# gmod-audio

This project recreates gmod's `gmod_audio.dll` using bass `2.4.17`.  
Gmod currently uses bass `2.4.15`.  

Everything seems to work fine with the newer version of bass, but It should still be tested a bit more.  
If you have any issues with this or find any bugs, feel free to open an issue for it.  

## How to Install
Download the `gmod_audio.dll` and `bass.dll` from the lastest release and drop replace gmod's original versions in the `GarrysMod/bin` folder
